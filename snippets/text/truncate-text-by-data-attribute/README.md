## Webflow - Truncate Text by Data Attribute

This code is written in JavaScript and is designed to truncate text within HTML elements based on a custom attribute called "truncate-text". Here's a breakdown of the code:

1\.  The code is enclosed in a Webflow push function to ensure it runs after the Webflow library has loaded.  
2\.  \`$("\[truncate-text\]")\` is a jQuery selector that selects all HTML elements with the custom attribute "truncate-text".  
3\.  The \`.each()\` function is used to iterate through each selected element.  
4\.  \`const maxLength = $(this).attr("truncate-text");\` retrieves the max length value from the custom attribute "truncate-text" for the current element.  
5\.  The \`if\` statement checks if the text length of the current element exceeds the max length value.  
6\.  If the text length is greater than the max length, the text is truncated using the \`.substring()\` method, and ellipsis are added to the end of the truncated text.  
7\.  The truncated text is then set as the new text content of the current element using the \`.text()\` method.

This code is useful for automatically truncating text within elements based on a custom max length value, which can help maintain consistent text lengths and improve the visual appearance of a website.
